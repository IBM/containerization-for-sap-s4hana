## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/IBM/containerization-for-sap-s4hana/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the code base and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IBM/containerization-for-sap-s4hana/issues).


**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/containerization-for-sap-s4hana/issues) before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/containerization-for-sap-s4hana/issues) before sending a pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the maintainers of each component affected.

<!--
For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach. e.g.

```
/*
Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) which automatically asks you to sign the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://gist.github.com/jridfe/cb9ed03deb37baa644e64eea3a327065) when you open a pull request. For more information see the description of a pull request workflow in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/reicolina/f30d7475157f3bf21ec6807a6caff85a).
